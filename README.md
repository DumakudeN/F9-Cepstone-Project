# F9-Cepstone-Project

By gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. 
I will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. 
Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, 
I will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
